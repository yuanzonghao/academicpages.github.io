# Working Project

## 1. The influence of hierarchy degree within mentorship.
In this study, I want to answer questions below: 
- As for flat teams can promote innovation, then how about flat mentors' affect towards their mentees?
- How hierarchy degree and mentors' leadership flat tendancy distribute between different countries and subjects? What about gender and race?
- Do the corelation between mentors' leadership flat tendancy and scientific success differ in different countries, subjects, gender, race?
- How mentors' flat tendancy change when their academic age grow up, and whether the change differ between different features of mentor?
- ...more to explore...

## 2. The evolution of hierarchy degree within teams.
This study is at the very beginning. Maybe flat teams mainly exist in new teams, and those who turns into hierarchical teams can survive longer, even at the expense of lower-ranking members' academic career.
