# Working Project

## 1. The influence of hierarchy degree within mentorship.
In this study, I want to answer the questions below: 
- As for flat teams can promote innovation, then how about flat mentors' effect on their mentees?
- How are hierarchy degrees and mentors' leadership flat tendencies distributed between different countries and subjects? What about gender and race?
- Does the correlation between mentors' leadership flat tendency and scientific success differ in different countries, subjects, genders, and races?
- How do mentors' flat tendencies change when their academic age grows up, and whether the change differ between different features of mentors?
- ...more to explore...

## 2. The evolution of hierarchy degree within teams.
This study is at the very beginning. Maybe flat teams mainly exist in new teams, and those that turns into hierarchical teams can survive longer, even at the expense of lower-ranking members' academic careers.
